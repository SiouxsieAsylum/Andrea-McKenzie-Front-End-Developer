This is the first iteration of a combination resume and portfolio page for Andrea McKenzie, an up-and-coming full stack developer with experience in:
- Git and Group Git
- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- Java
- Javascript 
- PSQL
- Node.js
- Express.js
- React
- HTML 
and yes... CSS!

During her tutilage at [Per Scholas's](https://perscholas.org/) [#Codebridge](https://perscholas.org/apply/codebridge) program and at [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly/) [Web Development Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive), Andrea came to excel in creative, inspired, responsive designs in her client-side designs while developing very thoroughly structured database schemas in her `Express.js` and `PSQL` applications. Prior to this formal education, Andrea graduated from [CUNY Hunter College]() *Cum Laude* with a Bachelors of Arts and was self-taught in `Ruby`,`Java`,and `Git` for two years. 

As a hobby, however, Andrea took up DOM manipulation and CSS tricks for designs and drawings. Each oage of her resume site is a different css drawing depicting a new scene or landscape.
